# Wintermeyer Consulting Homepage

For the static part of my business homepage https://www.wintermeyer-consulting.de I use Jekyll.
Main reasons:

- A static page is hard to break.
- WebPerformance

More information about Jekyll: http://jekyllrb.com

## Developement

Git clone the repository. Run bundle and fire up the
development version with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
